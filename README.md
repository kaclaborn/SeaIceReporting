# Sea Ice Reporting

# July 2022


This project seeks to analyze how sea ice is discussed and framed in Alaskan news reporting (specifically looking within the Alaska Dispatch News). It utilizes a corpus-based approach to identify collocations, co-occurrences, LDA topic models, and relevant derived metrics from these analyses.
