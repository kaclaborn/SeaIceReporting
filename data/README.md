# Organizing your data folder

### Corpus data

For access to the raw files used in the corpus development for this project, please contact Kelly Claborn at kelly.claborn@asu.edu

### Example output data

To aid in replicability for this specific study (and the subsequent manuscript to be submitted for peer review), output files from LDA topic models run on April 9, 2022 are included in the "exampleOutput" folder. Topic modelling is probabilistic so will lead to slight variations from run to run.
